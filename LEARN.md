## Programming Language Proficiency

- Deep understanding of at least one programming language (e.g., Python, Java, JavaScript, C++).
- Mastering syntax, semantics, and idiomatic patterns.
- Writing clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- Debugging and troubleshooting code effectively.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

- Core data structures: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, graphs.
- Common algorithms: sorting (merge sort, quicksort), searching (binary search), graph traversal (DFS/BFS).
- Understanding time complexity (Big O notation) and space complexity.
- Problem-solving using algorithmic thinking.

## Debugging Skills

- Reading and interpreting error messages and stack traces.
- Using debugging tools effectively (e.g., IDE debuggers, breakpoints).
- Tracing code execution manually to identify issues.
- Formulating hypotheses about bugs and testing them systematically.

## Version Control

- Proficiency with Git:
  - Basic commands: `clone`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `branch`, `merge`.
  - Resolving merge conflicts manually.
  - Creating pull requests and reviewing code changes.
  - Understanding branching strategies (e.g., Git Flow).
- Navigating commit history to identify changes.

## System Design Basics

- Understanding modular design principles:
  - Separation of concerns.
  - Designing reusable components/interfaces.
- Basics of database design:
  - Normalization and relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many).
  - Query optimization.
- Designing scalable systems:
  - Load balancing.
  - Horizontal vs. vertical scaling.

## Observability

- Logging best practices: structured logging and log aggregation tools (e.g., ELK Stack).
- Metrics collection: using tools like Prometheus or Datadog for monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Distributed tracing: implementing OpenTelemetry to track requests across services.

## Testing Fundamentals

- Writing unit tests for individual functions or modules.
- Test-driven development (TDD) workflow:
  - Writing tests before implementation.
  - Refactoring while maintaining test coverage.
- Identifying edge cases and writing robust test cases.
- Understanding integration testing and end-to-end testing

## Problem-Solving & Critical Thinking

- SOLID principles:
  - Single Responsibility Principle
  - Open/Closed Principle
  - Liskov Substitution Principle
  - Interface Segregation Principle
  - Dependency Inversion Principle
- DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid).
- Understanding design patterns like Singleton, Factory, Observer.

## Performance Optimization

- Profiling code to identify bottlenecks (CPU/memory usage).
- Optimizing algorithms for efficiency:
  - Reducing time complexity where possible.
  - Minimizing unnecessary computations or loops.
- Implementing caching mechanisms to speed up applications.

## Security Best Practices

- Input validation to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS).
- Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms:
  - Hashing passwords securely (e.g., bcrypt).
  - Implementing role-based access control (RBAC).
- Avoiding common vulnerabilities:
  - Hardcoding secrets or credentials in code.
  - Using secure communication protocols like HTTPS.

## Networking Fundamentals

- Understanding HTTP/HTTPS protocols:
  - GET/POST requests.
  - Status codes (200 OK, 404 Not Found).
- Basics of RESTful APIs:
  - Designing endpoints for CRUD operations.
  - Using tools like Postman for testing APIs.
- Familiarity with DNS, IP addresses, firewalls, and ports.

## Database Management

- Writing efficient SQL queries:
  - Joins (INNER JOIN, OUTER JOIN), subqueries, indexes.
  - Optimizing queries for performance.
- Understanding NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB):
  - When to use NoSQL vs SQL databases.
  - Setting up database schemas and migrations.

## Operating Systems & Command Line

- Navigating file systems using terminal commands (`ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, etc.).
- Managing processes (`ps`, `kill`) and monitoring system resources (`top`).
- Writing shell scripts for automation tasks (bash scripting basics).
- Understanding OS concepts like threads, processes, memory allocation.

## Fundamentals of Software Deployment

- Containerization with Docker:
  - Writing Dockerfiles to containerize applications.
  - Managing containers (`docker run`, `docker stop`).
- Basics of CI/CD pipelines:
  - Automating builds and deployments using tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
  - Deploying applications on cloud platforms like AWS or Azure.

## Communication & Collaboration Skills

While technical skills are critical, mastering communication is equally important:

1. Writing clear documentation for your code or projects.
2. Explaining technical concepts to non-engineers effectively.
3. Participating in code reviews constructively by providing actionable feedback.
