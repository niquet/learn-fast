# Learn Fast

**Learn by doing.** Build small, focused deliverables that apply the concept or topic you're trying to learn. Stay focused on the bare minimum knowledge required to solve a problem or build something useful. _Learn just enough to take action._ Once that's working, expand incrementally.

## 0. Clarify Your Purpose

Clarify **why** do you need to learning this concept/topic. Identify the smallest unit of knowledge that would allow you to do something useful.

**Questions to ask yourself**

- What tasks am I currently unable to complete?
- What problem am I trying to solve?
- What outcome do I need?
- What concepts do I struggle to explain to others?
- Which errors or issues repeatedly challenge me?
- What’s the smallest thing I can build to make progress?

**Example**

Scenario:

> You’re trying to debug latency issues in your microservices. You realize that distributed tracing could help you pinpoint bottlenecks but don’t know how it works.

Action:

> Start by identifying the smallest step: "Learn how to instrument one service with spans and trace IDs using the OpenTelemetry SDK in Python."

## 1. Isolate and Break Down the Topic

Focus on **what** you’re trying to learn or solve. Break it down into manageable chunks or use cases that take just a few minutes to understand.

**Questions to ask yourself**

- What are the key building blocks of this concept?
- What’s essential vs. optional for my current goal?
- Can I align these building blocks with small, actionable tasks?

Turn vague thoughts into actionable tasks using the SMART framework:

-   **Specific:** "Implement a logging system that captures errors" instead of "learn logging."
-   **Measurable:** Define concrete outcomes (e.g., "Create a working prototype with 3 design patterns").
-   **Achievable:** Choose tasks you can complete with your current resources.
-   **Relevant:** Ensure tasks directly apply to your work or projects.
-   **Time-bound:** Set deadlines for each milestone.

**Example**

Scenario:

> You want to understand design patterns but feel overwhelmed by the number of patterns available.

Action:

> Focus on one pattern at a time:
> - Start with the Observer Pattern by refactoring a notification system in your codebase.
> - Once comfortable, move on to Factory Pattern by creating a system for generating different types of objects dynamically.

Tip: _Spend no more than 10–15 minutes on this step—analysis paralysis is your enemy! Create a "read later" list for anything non-essential to avoid rabbit holes.._

## 2. Timebox the Build Loop

Start building small proof-of-concept implementations. Focus on quick experiments designed to test your understanding or solve part of the problem.

**Guidelines**

1. Spend 25 minutes implementing something tangible (even if it’s broken).
2. Take a 5-minute break to reflect or reset before continuing.
3. Use the "touch it once" principle: work on the task until completion or until time runs out.
4. Focus on making it work before making it perfect. (_"Make it work. Make it right. Make it fast."_)

**Example**

Scenario:

> You’re learning how to use Docker for containerization but feel stuck on setup.

Action:

> Define a small proof-of-concept task: "Create a Dockerfile for a simple Flask application and run it locally." Spend 25 minutes building this, even if it’s imperfect.

If you hit a blocker, pause and ask yourself:

1. What’s not working? Why?
2. What specific question do I need answered right now?

Tip: _Refine your thinking and expose gaps in understanding before outsourcing answers. Before turning to AI tools, rely on forums like StackOverflow, GitHub discussions, or even rubber duck debugging (explaining your problem out loud)._

## 3. Reflect on Your Understanding

After each session, take a few minutes to **document** what you’ve learned and identify gaps in your understanding. 

**Use the Feynman Technique**

1.  Write down the concept at the top of a page.
2.  Explain it in simple terms as if teaching someone else (or a rubber duck).
3.  Identify gaps in your explanation—these are areas to revisit later.

**Checklist**

- [ ] What did I learn today? (1–2 sentences)
- [ ] What gaps remain in my understanding? (specific questions)

**Example**

Scenario:

> After implementing distributed tracing, you notice gaps in your understanding of parent-child relationships between spans.

Action:

> Use the Feynman Technique: Write down "How spans propagate context between services" and explain it as if teaching someone new to tracing.

## 4. Teach It Back

Teaching something to others or applying it in new contexts exposes gaps you might not notice otherwise.

**Ways to Teach Back**

1.  **Pull Request Reviews:** Submit a PR showcasing your implementation and ask reviewers specific questions about areas you're unsure of.
2.  **Write About It:** Create a blog post, README section, or internal documentation explaining what you learned.
3.  **Open Source Contribution:** Apply what you’ve learned by contributing to an open-source project.
4.  **Pair Programming:** Teach someone else while pairing on similar tasks.

**Example**

Scenario:

> You’ve learned how to use Kubernetes for deploying applications but want to solidify your knowledge.

Action:

> Write a blog post titled "Deploying a Flask App on Kubernetes: Lessons Learned." Include challenges faced, solutions implemented, and key takeaways.

Tip: _Teaching doesn’t have to be formal—recording yourself explaining something (e.g., Loom videos) can be just as effective._

## Why Learn Without Over-Reliance on AI Tools?

**Build mental models**

Independent learning develops a deeper understanding of concepts that AI-generated solutions can't provide directly.

**Problem-solving confidence**

You'll learn how to approach challenges systematically without relying on external tools as a crutch.

**Adaptability**

Technology evolves rapidly; mastering fundamentals ensures you're prepared for future advancements without being tied to specific tools.
